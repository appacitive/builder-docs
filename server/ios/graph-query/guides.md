## Graph Search

Graph queries offer immense potential when it comes to traversing and mining for connected data. There are two kinds of graph queries, filter and projection.

### Creating graph queries

You can create filter and projection graph queries from the management portal. When you create such queries from the portal, you are required to assign a unique name with every saved search query. You can then use this name to execute the query from your app by making the appropriate api call to Appacitive.

### Executing Filter graph queries

You can execute a saved graph query (filter or projection) by using itâ€™s name that you assigned to it while creating it from the management portal. You will need to send any placeholders you might have set up while creating the query.

```objectivec
[APGraphNode applyFilterGraphQuery:@"namefilter" usingPlaceHolders:@{@"firstname":@"Jonathan", @"lastname":@"White"} successHandler:^(NSArray *objects) {
        NSLog(@"ObjectIds:");
        for(NSString *obj in objects)
            NSLog(@"\n%@",obj);
    }];
```
