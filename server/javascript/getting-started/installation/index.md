##Installing SDK
To install the SDK complete the following two steps.

### Download & unzip the Project
Make sure you are using Xamarin.iOS 6.3 or above. Note that you may need to use a beta channel release to get this version of Xamarin.iOS.

### Add the SDK to your app
Before continuing, select your Parse app from the menu at the right. These steps are for your "panda" app.
Unzip the file and open ParseiOSStarterProject.sln with Visual Studio 2012 or Xamarin Studio. Within AppDelegate.cs, specify your application id and .NET key in your AppDelegate constructor.
