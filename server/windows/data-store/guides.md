# Data Store

The simplest use case of Appacitive is storing and retrieving data to and from your cloud backend.

The basic unit of data is an object and objects of the same kind are organized in collections. An object is a strongly type entity which is stored in the backend in JSON format. Appacitive's iOS SDK automatically translate your native objects to JSON.

Appacitive's data store provides simple CRUD operations on data, as well as powerful filtering and aggregation.
